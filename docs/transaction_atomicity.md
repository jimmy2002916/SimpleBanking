# Transaction Atomicity

## Overview
Transaction atomicity ensures operations either complete fully or not at all. This is critical for financial systems to maintain data integrity.

## Implementation
The SimpleBanking system implements atomicity through:

```python
# Using the transaction manager
transaction_manager = TransactionManager()
result = transaction_manager.execute_atomic(
    account_ids=[account_id],
    accounts_dict=accounts,
    operation_function=custom_operation
)
```

## Key Features
1. **All-or-Nothing Execution**: Operations either succeed completely or fail completely
2. **Automatic Rollback**: If any part of a transaction fails, all changes are reverted
3. **Consistent State**: System remains in a valid state even after failures

## Example: Fund Transfer
When transferring money between accounts:
1. Both accounts are locked
2. Source account balance is checked
3. Source account is debited
4. Destination account is credited
5. If any step fails, all changes are rolled back

## Benefits
- Prevents partial updates that could corrupt data
- Maintains account balance integrity
- Simplifies error handling
- Provides foundation for concurrent operations
