## Overview
The SimpleBanking system implements a scalable logging architecture designed to handle large volumes of transaction data in enterprise environments. This architecture follows a modular design pattern that decouples log generation from storage and processing, allowing the system to scale from a simple file-based implementation to a distributed enterprise solution.

## Architecture Components and Files

The logging architecture is implemented across several files in the `advanced_features/logging` directory:

1. **Transaction Logger** (`transaction_logger.py`)
   - Main entry point for the banking system
   - Provides backward compatibility with existing code
   - Delegates actual logging to the scalable architecture

2. **Architecture Interfaces** (`architecture/interfaces.py`)
   - Defines core abstractions through interfaces:
     - `LogEntry`: Standardized container for log data
     - `ILogProducer`: Generates log entries (implemented by banking systems)
     - `ILogProcessor`: Processes and enriches log entries
     - `ILogConsumer`: Stores or forwards log entries
     - `ILogRouter`: Routes logs to appropriate processors
     - `ILogEnricher`: Adds additional context to log entries
     - `LoggingConfig`: Configuration settings for the logging system

3. **Facade** (`architecture/facade.py`)
   - Provides a simplified interface to the complex logging architecture
   - Instantiates and wires together the components
   - Exposes high-level methods for logging operations
   - Creates a singleton instance for easy access

4. **Simple Implementation** (`architecture/simple_implementation.py`)
   - Concrete implementations of the interfaces:
     - `SimpleLogProcessor`: Basic log processing
     - `FileLogConsumer`: File-based storage (current implementation)
     - `TimestampEnricher`: Adds timestamps to logs
     - `SimpleLogRouter`: Routes logs based on action type
     - `BankingSystemLogProducer`: Adapter for the banking system

5. **Enterprise Placeholders** (`architecture/enterprise_placeholders.py`)
   - Interface implementations for enterprise integrations:
     - `IKafkaLogConsumer`: For Kafka integration
     - `ILogstashProcessor`: For Logstash integration
     - `IFilebeatCollector`: For Filebeat integration
     - `IElasticsearchConsumer`: For Elasticsearch integration
     - `IWORMStorageConsumer`: For compliance storage

## Dependency Hierarchy

The actual dependency hierarchy of the components (which files import which):

1. **interfaces.py** - Defines all interfaces (no dependencies)
2. **simple_implementation.py** - Implements interfaces (depends on interfaces.py)
3. **facade.py** - Creates and wires components (depends on interfaces.py and simple_implementation.py)
4. **transaction_logger.py** - Provides API (depends on facade.py)
5. **banking_system.py** - Uses logger (depends on transaction_logger.py)
6. **main.py** - Entry point (depends on banking_system.py)

## Data Flow

1. **main.py** creates a `TransactionLogger` and attaches it to the `BankingSystem`
2. The `BankingSystem` performs a transaction and calls `TransactionLogger.log_transaction()`
3. `TransactionLogger` formats the data and delegates to `LoggingFacade`
4. `LoggingFacade` creates a `LogEntry` and passes it to `BankingSystemLogProducer`
5. `BankingSystemLogProducer` notifies attached processors
6. `SimpleLogProcessor` processes the log and enriches it via `TimestampEnricher`
7. `SimpleLogRouter` determines which consumer should receive the log
8. `FileLogConsumer` writes the log to the file system

## Enterprise Scaling Path

The current implementation uses file-based logging, but the architecture is designed to scale to enterprise requirements:

1. **Current Implementation**: File-based logging via `FileLogConsumer`
2. **Mid-scale Upgrade**: Replace with `SQLiteConsumer` (not yet implemented)
3. **Enterprise Deployment**:
   - Replace `FileLogConsumer` with `KafkaLogConsumer`
   - Add `LogstashProcessor` for filtering and transformation
   - Add `ElasticsearchConsumer` for searchable storage
   - Add `WORMStorageConsumer` for compliance requirements

## Implementation Example

```python
# In main.py
logger = TransactionLogger("logs/transactions.log")
banking_system.attach_logger(logger)

# In banking_system.py when a transaction occurs
self.logger.log_transaction("deposit", {"account_id": "123", "amount": 100.00})

# The TransactionLogger delegates to LoggingFacade
# LoggingFacade.log_event(event_type, data)
```

This architecture allows the SimpleBanking system to start with a simple file-based implementation while providing a clear path to scale up to enterprise-level big data processing as requirements grow.
