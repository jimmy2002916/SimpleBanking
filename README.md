# Simple Banking System

A Python-based banking system for managing accounts and transactions.

## Features

### Basic Features
1. Create bank accounts with a name and starting balance
2. Deposit money to accounts
3. Withdraw money from accounts
4. Prevent overdrafting accounts
5. Transfer money between accounts in the same banking system
6. Save and load system state to CSV

### Advanced Features
- **[Transaction Management](docs/transaction_atomicity.md)**: Ensures atomicity and thread safety
- **[Transaction Logging](docs/logging_scalability.md)**: Logs all banking operations
- **[Database Storage](docs/database_storage.md)**: Optional SQLite storage (`-DStorage sqlite`)

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required for basic functionality
- SQLite3 (included in Python standard library) for database storage

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleBanking.git
   cd SimpleBanking
   ```

2. No additional installation steps required - the system uses only Python standard libraries.

### Running the Application

#### Basic Usage with CSV Storage (Default)
```
python main.py
```

#### Using SQLite Storage
```
python main.py -DStorage sqlite -DStoragePath data/banking.db
```

### Using Docker

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

#### Building the Docker Image
1. Navigate to the SimpleBanking directory (where the Dockerfile is located):
   ```
   cd /path/to/SimpleBanking
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t simple-banking .
   ```

#### Running with Docker
All commands below should be run from the SimpleBanking directory:

1. Run with default CSV storage (Data will be lost when container is removed):
   ```
   docker run -it --name banking-app simple-banking
   ```

2. Run with SQLite storage (Data will be lost when container is removed):
   ```
   docker run -it --name banking-app simple-banking -DStorage sqlite
   ```

3. Run with persistent data storage (âœ… RECOMMENDED):
   ```
   docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data --name banking-app simple-banking
   ```

4. Run with both persistent data and specific storage type (RECOMMENDED):
   ```
   docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data --name banking-app simple-banking -DStorage sqlite -DStoragePath data/banking.db
   ```

#### Important: Saving Your Data

When using Docker, follow these steps to ensure your data is saved:

1. **Always use volume mounting** (`-v $(pwd)/data:/app/data`) to persist your data
2. **Save system state before exiting** by selecting option 6 (Save system state) or option 9 (Exit) from the menu
3. **Use the same container name** when restarting to maintain your container state:
   ```
   docker start -i banking-app
   ```

If you don't follow these steps, your account data will be lost when the container stops!

#### Managing Docker Containers

1. Stop the container:
   ```
   docker stop banking-app
   ```

2. Restart an existing container (preserves container state):
   ```
   docker start -i banking-app
   ```

3. Remove the container (This will delete container state):
   ```
   docker rm banking-app
   ```

### Command-Line Options
- `-DStorage`: Storage type to use (`csv` or `sqlite`). Default is `csv`.
- `-DStoragePath`: Path to the storage file. If not provided, defaults to:
  - `data/banking_data.csv` for CSV storage
  - `data/banking.db` for SQLite storage

### Interactive Menu
Once running, the application presents an interactive menu:
1. Create a new account
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
4. Transfer money
5. View account details
6. Save system state
7. Load system state
8. View transaction logs
9. Exit

Enter the number corresponding to the desired action and follow the prompts.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture organized by functional domains:
- `basic_required_features/`: Core banking functionality
- `advanced_features/`: Enhanced functionality modules

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains detailed documentation on various aspects of the system:

- **[Transaction Atomicity](docs/transaction_atomicity.md)**: How the system ensures operations complete fully or not at all
- **[Logging Scalability](docs/logging_scalability.md)**: How the logging system scales for big data applications
- **[Database Storage](docs/database_storage.md)**: Details on the SQLite storage implementation

## System Summary

This banking system is designed to be simple, robust, and secure, supporting key functionalities such as account creation, balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction history.

At the heart of the system is the principle of **transaction atomicity**. The `TransactionManager` class ensures that operations involving money are executed atomically through the following mechanisms:

* A context manager (`atomic_transaction`) acquires locks on all involved accounts in a sorted order to avoid deadlocks
* Account balances are backed up before any changes are made
* If an exception occurs during the transaction, the system rolls back to the previous state

The system supports **concurrent operations** through the `TransactionManager` which:
* Uses thread locks (`threading.RLock`) to protect account access
* Ensures no two operations can modify the same account simultaneously
* Acquires locks in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks

**Transaction logging** is implemented through the `TransactionLogger` class, which:
* Records all banking operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
* Timestamps each transaction
* Stores success/failure status and reason codes
* Provides methods to retrieve transaction history by account or action type

The system includes **input validation** for all operations:
* Account names cannot be empty
* Initial balances cannot be negative
* Deposit and withdrawal amounts must be positive
* Withdrawals cannot exceed available balance

**Storage flexibility** is provided through:
* An `IStorage` interface that abstracts storage operations
* `CSVStorage` implementation for simple file-based storage
* `SQLiteStorage` implementation for database storage
* A `StorageFactory` to create the appropriate storage implementation

**Account ID formatting** ensures consistency:
* All account IDs follow the format ACC0001 (ACC followed by a 4-digit number)
* The system properly handles both new and existing account IDs
* The `_determine_next_account_id` method ensures unique IDs are assigned

**Error handling** is robust throughout the system:
* Transactions are rolled back on failure
* Detailed error messages are provided
* Failed operations are logged with reason codes

## Future Work

The following enhancements are planned for future development:

1. **User Authentication and Security**:
   * Implement secure user authentication
   * Add password protection for account access
   * Implement role-based access control

2. **Enhanced Banking Features**:
   * Support for different account types (savings, checking)
   * Interest calculation for savings accounts
   * Scheduled/recurring transactions
   * Support for multiple currencies

3. **Improved User Interface**:
   * Develop a web-based frontend
   * Create a mobile application
   * Implement a more intuitive command-line interface

4. **Advanced Storage and Performance**:
   * Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   * Add support for distributed database systems
   * Optimize transaction processing for high-volume scenarios

5. **Notification System**:
   * Email alerts for significant account activities
   * SMS notifications for transactions
   * Customizable notification preferences

6. **Reporting and Analytics**:
   * Generate account statements and reports
   * Provide transaction analytics and insights
   * Export data in various formats (PDF, CSV, etc.)

7. **System Resilience**:
   * Implement advanced backup and recovery mechanisms
   * Add comprehensive error monitoring
   * Improve logging for better diagnostics and auditing
